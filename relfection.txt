1.1 What concerns, if any, do you have about using an LLM in this way? 
Think from the perspective of an engineer: how might an LLM’s training data in this case 
impact the mocked data it is returning?

Since the LLM only learned from training data then any bias will be reflected in the mocked data
that it outputs. That's why the engineer needs to make sure that the LLM comes from a reliable source
that has prevented bias in their LLM. It also depends what resources were used in the training dataset,
and this can also impact the output of the model.

1.2 What might “bias” mean in this context? I.e., what kinds of bias might you specifically 
want to mitigate when you use an LLM to generate test data?

Bias would mean being more likely to output some type of information than other ones that are equally likely
to appear in a real-world setting. For example, if you only train an LLM on wikipedia articles, it might not be able
to create code or some other output in a structure different than what it has seen before.
I would want to mitigate socioeconomic or demographic bias.

1.3 How did you attempt to mitigate the above concerns, if any? 

I tried to mitigate them by asking the LLM for a specific kind of json data, for example with only text input, 
or number input, or an empty dataset.
